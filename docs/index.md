Hi there!

My name is **Temidayo Azeez**. I am a **Technical Writer** and **Content Marketer**. 

### Technical Writing

As a technical writer, I create **technical content** and **documentation** around **developer tools and frameworks**, **product and APIs**, on **technical topics**, as well as, **opinion posts and thought leadership content** related to technical writing and software engineering. 

I am skilled at creating technical documentation with several authoring tools, such as `Mkdocs`, `Sphinx`, `Jeckll` and `Readthedocs`. 

I create the following technical writing content deliverables:

- Technical overview
- Installation/setup/configuration guide
- Getting started/Hello World
- Tutorials (training materials)
- How-To's (Recipes and cookbooks)
- Reference guides (Web APIs)
- Thought leadership content/Opinion posts on technical topics (blogposts and articles)

### Content Marketing

As a content marketer, I am able to deploy my **storytelling**, **argumentative**, and **content creation skills** to create compelling content that appeals to **target audience (reader-content fit)**, addresses their **specific pain-points (specificity)**, then communicate the **unique value proposition** of a product aimed towards solving **those specific user/customer problems (originality)**.

I am also skilled at  SEO (search engine optimization) to ensure content discoverability on search engine.

With content marketing, I am skilled at using the funnel framework(TOFU, MOFU, BOFU) for content creation. I create the following content marketing content types:

- Thought leadership content (TOFU, MOFU)
- How-to posts (TOFU, MOFU, BOFU)
- Opinion posts (TOFU, MOFU)
- Customer success stories/Usecases (BOFU)
- Comparison blogposts (BOFU)

!!! info
    TOFU, MOFU, BOFU means **top-of-the-funnel content, middle-of-the-funnel content, and bottom-of-the-funnel content** respectively.
  
!!! info
    It should be noted that the "how-to" marketing content type is fundamentally different from "how-to's" as it exist in technical writing.
