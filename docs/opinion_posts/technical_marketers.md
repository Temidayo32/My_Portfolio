 Technical Marketers. I know the term sounds weird (is that even a good word blend?).  

I couldn't figure the right term that makes the best sense, but for the purpose of this article, the word blend would work just fine (feel free to suggest a better one in the comments).

That said, let's get to the purpose of this article.

Recently, on LinkedIn, I observed a discussion relevant to technical writers that I believe have never been broached or discussed among technical writers—at least, not a widespread discussion.

Here is a snapshot of some of the posts.

The motivation and reasoning behind these posts are simple: **crediting technical writers with their true worth**.

Traditionally, discussions around increasing leads, converting leads, and improving ROI have largely been attributed to efforts of the marketing and sales teams in an organization. 

But what about technical writers? Does documentation produced by technical writers contribute nothing to the ROI bucket?

Let’s go back in time and bring in some backstory…

With the rise and maturation of the B2B SaaS space, and the consequent boom of APIs, API and product documentation have become even more important elements in most B2B SaaS companies, especially developer-facing B2B SaaS companies.

It is common knowledge today that for an API to be labelled "good", then it must be with a "good" documentation.

Tom Johnson, owner of idratherbewriting.com, has this in his API documentation course.

<figure markdown align="center">
<h3><i>“Why are developers not using your APIs?</i></h3>
</figure>

<figure markdown align="center">
  <h3><i>… because your documentation sucks.”</i></h3>
</figure>

Aside from Tom Johnson, data, research, and studies over time have confirmed this fact over and over again: **without good documentation, developers will not use your API. Simple. Period.**

Now, this fact raises some disturbing questions about how documentation—and technical writers (I will get this later on in the post)—is perceived. Till now, documentation is mostly perceived as a "necessary evil" or simply "following standards" or as a "reference guide for developers" and the list could run. 

But here is my point, if documentation is so important to convince developers to use an API, **isn't it high time it is added to documentation the important role it also plays in marketing?**

I know this may sound weird. When we think of marketing content, we think of copywriting, of showing all the “goods” about your product (API), talking about all the benefits of your API, how your product is better than its competitors, and saying little to nothing about the limitations of your product.

It could be hard seeing a technical documentation as a marketing content: it's bare bone nature, and it's almost lack, most times, of any mention of benefits (more emphasis on description of features than talking about their benefits), and the ever presence of limitations, inabilities, and “lack of certain functionalities” (that may be critical to certain potential users) of the product scattered throughout the documentation.

But interestingly, it is this very nature of technical documentation (transparency) that makes it very attractive to developers and API users. While  conventional marketing content would be labelled high quality based on how best they are able to convey the benefits of a product, **technical documentation would be labelled high quality based on its transparency—technical writers are called user-advocates for a good reason**.

Technical documentation helps developers get past conventional marketing content that are constantly trying to sell them, and get to assess the product for themselves: to get all the information they need to make the best decisions; to determine the worth of the product for themselves based on their own terms and needs, not based on the values and benefits communicated by conventional marketing content.

In summary, as opposed to conventional marketing content, technical documentation is what you might think of as a **"completely transparent" marketing content**. 

And that makes a lot of sense if you think about it.

If the goal of conventional marketing content is to convert leads into customers towards growing your ROI; and the goal of technical documentation is towards improving the attractiveness of your API in order to increase adoption by developers, hence converting them (leads) to users of your API(customers), with the end goal of growing your ROI just like conventional marketing content, I don't see any reason why technical documentation can't be perceived also as marketing content. Transparent marketing content, specifically.

**That said, what position in organizations/businesses/companies does this leave the "brains" (technical writers) behind technical documentation?** 

For a long time, Technical writers have existed in the background. Companions of  developers. Necessary evils. It has never been attributed to them the role they also play in contributing to the ROI bucket.

To the best of my knowledge, from discussion I have observed on LinkedIn with experts that have stayed long in the field, technical writers have not been fully acknowledged for the important roles they play, at least, not for the part they play in growing ROI.
If technical documentation is also marketing content as I argued, and hence, plays a key role in lead conversion into customers, then technical writers also deserve to be honored and credited, in the same manner as the marketing and sales teams, with their contribution to the ROI bucket.

Now, you might wonder, what could be the possible benefits of this? Of recognizing and crediting technical writers with their contribution to the ROI bucket?

I will give you some:

An instant benefit is that it would bring technical writers out from the background and plant them in the spotlight to become a part of key decision authorities in any business organization. 

The consequent benefit of this is exponential: increase in the working condition of technical writers; an ability of technical writers to also table directly "their needs" instead of depending on the CTO or on other authority figures that would mostly delay attention to their needs (bureaucracy) and more. 

As a beginner, my ability to expound on the benefits of "bringing technical writers to the decision table" by endorsing their important contribution to ROI is limited. But I trust experts technical writers reading this post right now and have spent a long time working as technical writers would have a wide girth of experience to enable them to stretch the benefit possibilities of this way further.

So let me know in the comments, what are some of the benefits to technical writers of endorsing their contribution to ROI, and consequently, the benefits to technical writers of being a part of the decision table.
