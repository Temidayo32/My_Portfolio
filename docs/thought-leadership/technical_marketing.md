When I first came into the digital space, I kicked off with an interest in creating marketing content for software products: blog posts, articles, comparisons, etc.

That lasted until March 2022 when I finally gave up on chasing a career in marketing (the rejection letters won’t stop coming) and quickly navigated into technical writing. I quickly noticed the growth potential was even bigger and there was more career stability.

Initially, the technical writing world scared me off: there were too many “technicals” to deal with. Making complex topics simple, could I do that?

Recently, I picked up training myself as a software engineer so I could better understand how developers use the tools I want to create technical content for. It is said, experience is the best teacher, right?

I also picked up this self-training so I could start creating my own portfolio pieces that would be based on my coding practical knowledge.

If you are very familiar with the software engineering/technical writing world, you will know that a majority of employers, if not all, will not hire you if you have zero experience.

Now, you must understand that when I pivoted from creating marketing content to technical content, there were some mental adjustments I made with respect to content creation.

While I have not lost the mental orientation for creating marketing content, the switch brought within me a need to know the difference between technical content and marketing content. I believe that should happen to anyone naturally. This natural curiosity and spur to better understand the world and whatever we deal with in our day to day lives.

Of course, I did my Google research, but none of the answers were satisfactory enough. They were either too shallow and weren’t hitting the nail on the head or they were totally off the mark.

So I started to think more about it: in what ways did technical writing differ from marketing content?

I mean the difference is right there when you stare at both content forms. Merely staring at them, and you will see the clear difference, the most obvious being the writing voice, tone and style. But I sought more concrete answers.

The epiphany didn’t come until the morning I woke up and was paging through a horrible piece that tried to explain the difference between marketing content and technical content and was doing a bad job at it. I was so angry I got an inspiration.

First, let me identify the specifics of how technical writing differ from marketing writing:

1. The content creation process

2. Content publication

## The Content Creation Process

Content creation is a big part of both writing forms. This is one of the junctions where both writing forms set off in different directions in search for content.

First, let’s talk about how marketing content writers sort for their content.

Ideally, to begin the content creation process, marketing writers would seek out the users and customers of a product.

This is done to understand the target audience they are writing for.

Extensively, especially for the rigorous marketing writers who are bent on creating top notch marketing content, they would follow up this initial research by consulting everyone in the company who is in contact with the customers of the company’s product.

This includes the customer service team, customer success team, c-executives, sales teams, product team, other marketers, and even technical documentation. It is a rigorous process.

At this point I must say, every single marketing content deliverable is **tightly coupled to writing content for a specific target audience**.

Now, you might wonder why do marketing writers use this length process?

Well, the answer is pretty simple. Marketing content relies heavily on exploiting grey areas, nuances, and pain points of the target audience they are writing for. Marketing writers must write in such a way as to ensure the **content resonates almost perfectly with the specific target audience**.

Discovering these grey areas, nuances, and pain points can only be achieved through a rigorous research process. Nuances and grey areas don’t easily unveil themselves. They need rigor and persistent research to find them.

It is usually more of an epiphany when you discover them, like a scientific research that gave way to a discovery.

Unfortunately, most marketing writers lack this rigor so they create bland content that have little to nothing to deal with the target audience they are writing for. But, that’s a discussion for another article.

Technical writers, on the other hand, have a much different process for content creation, and this depends also on their backgrounds.

In the technical writing world, we have software engineers that do technical writing. Let’s call them **developer technical writers**.

Then, we also have the technical writers who came into the technology industry as technical writers and that’s pretty much what they do. Mostly, they work as **in-house technical writers** for companies.

Developer technical writers work mostly as freelance technical writers (they have a software engineering day job), and usually, they create technical content by participating in developer community writer programs hosted by companies, and also by contributing content to community hubs for software engineers like Freecodecamp, Smashing Magazine, Hashnode, and Dev.to.

For developer technical writers, content creation is based totally on their practical coding knowledge and experience. It is no wonder most of their content consists of how-tos and tutorials.

Secondly, content creation by developer technical writers is **not tightly coupled** to writing for a specific target audience as you have with marketing content.

Content creation is more **experience-oriented** than target audience oriented. You write about what you know(practical knowledge). Period.

This is true because the need for a target audience oriented mindset for this type of technical writers is of **mild necessity**. More on this in content publication below.

Let’s talk about the second type of technical writers: **in-house technical writers**.

They work in-house as employees to create technical documentation for technical products. Documentation such as tutorials, how-tos, API reference guides, Getting Started, Installation guides, SDK documentation etc.

In-house technical writers source their technical content by consulting the technical team, the product team and the customer service team.

Tom Johnson, a lead technical writer, specifically identified some key set of people within a company that in-house technical writers consult in creating their technical documentation: **software engineers, product managers, partner engineers and the quality assurance engineers**.

In addition to this, in-house technical writers would also consult the customer service team for **support tickets to update technical documentation**.

This is in sharp contrast to marketing content writers who consult c-executives, customer success and sales team.

Although there could be instances where they consult the same team for their content, such as the customer service, their needs still differ.

While the in-house technical writers would consult the customer service for support tickets to discover frequently asked questions, the marketing writers would consider not just the FAQs, **but the entirety of the customer service** interaction with customers in order to have a solid grasp of customer pain points and needs.

Like developer technical writers, in-house technical writing is **also not tightly coupled to writing for a specific target audience** — except that they are of **different intensity**. In-house technical writers must pay more attention to their company target audience than developer technical writers would to their target audience.

Marketing writing, on the other hand, **is of more intensity when it comes to content creation for a specific target audience** compared to in-house technical writing.

While technical documentation could be written for a general set of people, marketing writing, which usually exists in most companies as another content layer over documentation (developer marketing and blogs), is where companies can tweak, experiment and create content to target **specific niche audiences** that cannot be covered or targeted in their main technical documentation content.

## Content Publication

Content management systems such as WordPress constitute one of the most used tools by marketing writers for content publication.

Marketing writers, especially in-house marketing writers, publish their content on their company blogs.

To increase the reach of their content, marketing content writers also utilize platforms such as Medium, and social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn to broadcast their content in different forms.

This could range from just republishing the content on these platforms (Medium), or distilling the content into mini copies (Twitter and LinkedIn) for consumption by their target audience.

This act constitutes what marketing content writers call **content distribution and repurposing**.

At this point, I must say that because marketing writers publish their content with a focus on a specific audience, we can describe content publication for marketing writers as **individualistic** in nature.

Marketing writers create content just to serve the **interest of a company or product**. There is no such thing as contributing content to a common bucket in marketing writing — a practice central to content publication by developer technical writers.

Developer technical writers publish their technical content mostly in communities like Freecodecamp, Smashing Magazine, Stackoverflow, Hashnode and Dev.to.

These are big platforms that host thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of pieces of technical content, and are followed by software developers all around the world.

The huge amount of content they host and the fact that content publication on these platforms are open to all software developers makes it possible for software developers to simply worry about creating content without bothering “too much” about a target audience.

In other words, by simply contributing to a common bucket (communities), they could create content without being too specific about a target audience.

The point here is that content publication for developer technical writers is **community based**, not from an individualistic viewpoint of a marketer trying to monetize a specific niche audience.

You will often hear software developers use terms such as “contributing to the developer community” when publishing their technical content.

For marketers, content publication is of a different mindset. It is about creating content that converts a target audience into paying customers.

For developer technical writers, the mindset is more of feeling satisfied giving back to the open source developer community that has built them.

In-house technical writers, on other hand, have a different publication channel for their technical content.

The only similarity with marketing content publication is that in-house technical content publication is also **individualistic** in nature. That is, content is created to serve a company or a product that has a target audience.

In-house technical writers, of all types of writers, possess the widest repertoire of authoring tools and platforms for publishing their content.

These tools are mostly called documentation tools. They include static site generators such as Mkdocs, Jeckll, Sphinx, Docusaurus, MadCap Flare; API documentation tools such as Slate; and XML authoring tools.

Methodology such as Doc-as-code and DITA also form a core of technical content documentation and publication for in-house technical writers that work on company products.

It should be noted that all these conventions have an impact on the writing style of most technical content. Most noticeable is its stricter writing style compared to marketing content.

In-house technical writers usually don’t engage in content re-publication and content repurposing like their marketing writer counterparts.

Instead, they spend their time maintaining documentation by ensuring content is up to date to reflect the most current version of the product the content is created for; then, updating them through the usage of support tickets to reduce the workload of customer service.

At this point, it is safe to say that while in-house technical content is more **user/product-focused**, marketing content is **target audience focused**, as I noted earlier.

This is true because when technical writers talk about creating and updating documentation, a large percentage of such decisions is motivated by a **change to the product or API** the documentation was written for.

On the other hand, it is not unusual for marketing writers to create new marketing content or update their existing marketing content to match a new or a different target audience.

As I have noted earlier, marketing content forms an extra layer of content over documentation. It serves as a tool for companies to create content to match specific target audiences.

This cannot be practiced with documentation as such will cause it to lose its main purpose, which is to provide information to users about the product — for a smoother user experience.

## Rounding up…

So that’s it about the difference between marketing writing and technical writing.
